I guess I was born in Switzerland in the middle of the last centum, but I'm not sure. My father was a
Navajo indian and I think that's how I got my name. If you're delusional enough to
think I have anything interesting to say, feel free to have a browse around. I can be contacted at wicked dot rainman at gmx dot co dot uk
