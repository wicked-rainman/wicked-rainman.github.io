	<h3>The Legend</h3>
	<p>I guess I was born in Switzerland in the middle of the last centum, but I'm not sure. My father was a
		Navajo indian and I guess that's how I got my name. If you're delusional enough to
		think I have anything interesting to say, feel free to have a browse around.</p>

<h3>Programming projects</h3>

<p>Spent quite a while writing the "Data Analist Programming Language (DAPL). It's supposed to make life
	a bit easier when your looking for interesting patterns of activity in things like Web logs Etc. 
	The whole idea seems to have fallen on deaf ears (maybe because it's no good), but I've left the code
	around just in case anyone shows any interest. See <a href="https://github.com/wicked-rainman/DAPL"</a>
	if you are interested...</p>
