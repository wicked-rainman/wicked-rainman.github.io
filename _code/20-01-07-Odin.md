__Odin with Hugin and Mumin__

Found a picture of Odin astride his horse Sleipnir, with [Hugin and Munin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn "Scholars have linked Odin's relation to Huginn and Muninn to shamanic practice.") on his sholders whilst visiting a [web site](https://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/others/hugin-and-munin/ "Norse Mythology for Smart People provides reliable, well-documented information on the enthralling mythology and religion of the Norse and other Germanic peoples. If that’s what you’re looking for, you’ve come to the right place.")
maintained by [Daniel McCoy](https://norse-mythology.org/about-me/ "Creator of the website and the writer of all of the articles on it"). I have a soft spot for old simplistic images like this and tried to reproduce it as a wooden relief panel.

He sends them out in the morning to fly around the whole world, and by breakfast they are back again. Thus, he finds out many new things and this is why he is called ‘raven-god’ (hrafnaguð).")

Apparently the image above has been taken from an Iron Age helment found in Sweden. I've copied it and tried to convert it 
to an SVG format so it can be re-scaled. Its stored [_here_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/Server-Vector-Graphics/blob/master/odin.svg) if you want to have a go yourself.
