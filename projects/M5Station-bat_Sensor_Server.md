I can spend many a happy hour looking out the windows as the clouds pass by (nothing to do with me being bored out of my skull). To enhance this
excitement I've built a portable weather station. It's all pointless because I never go anywhere, but that's besides the point.

My objectives were:

+ To make up an excuse to buy an M5Station-bat (because they look cool and have built in batteries that will give a long run time).
+ To see if I could hack together a string of sensors all attached to one I2C port
+ To have a go at moving from the Arduino IDE to Visual Studio Code and Platformio. 
+ Make something with a minimal web interface.
+ Design and print a cool case that makes it look like an expensive gadget.

As far as projects go, I think I met all the objectives except the last one. My 3D printer has given up the ghost, which is why all the sensors 
are just stuffed into a crappy box. At that stage I lost all interest - yet I'm still typing.

## Implementation
