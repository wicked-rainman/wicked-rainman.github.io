# War driving with an M5Stack

I sometimes view the [_M5Stack_](https://m5stack.com/ "You can buy them in the UK from several sources") as a neat substitute for an 
Arduino (I guess it all depends on what you plan to do). I was attracted to it because it's modular, comes in a cool case and has a built 
in display and buttons (Carrying around a board and wires wrapped in gaffer tape isn't a good look). 

I bougth the Fire version because it's red and has some additional built in sensors that the other versions don't 
have (Mostly, if I'm honest I bought it because its red). If you buy this version then you loose the use of some of the ESP32 IO pins, 
but [_you pays your money and you takes your choice!_](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/you-pays-your-money-and-you-takes-your-chance-choice "And 
you thought I was just using bad grammer")

There's also a range of backpack styled modules available. They get attached to the back of the unit and are held in place by magnets 
embedded in the case. All in all, quite a fun product to play with. I shelled out further and bought a GPS backpack. WiFi and Bluetooth 
are built in, so that meant I could write some [_war driving code and a bluetooth 
scanner_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/M5Stack-Fire "WiFi and Bluetooth scanning"). With the addition of a  usb battery bank, 
it seems to work very well!
