__Aercus weather station UDP broadcaster__

I got bored with using a Micro dot Phat for my indoor weather display, so instead I've branched out to write a UDP 
broadcaster for the weather values. It allows me to have an unlimited number of displays on various platforms. 
If it's of any interest, have a look at the code [_here_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/Aercus-Weather-Station). Enjoy!
