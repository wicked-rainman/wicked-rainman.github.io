__DAPL__     

Spent quite a while writing the __Data Analyst Programming Language__. It's supposed to make life a bit easier 
when your looking for interesting patterns of activity in things like Web logs Etc. The whole idea seems to have 
fallen on deaf ears (maybe because it's no good, or maybe because the 
[_target audience_](https://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Cyber_Specials "Cyber Police volunteers - but because 
it's a new line of work for the Police, all the volunteers have given up trying") couldn't see past the end of 
their noses), but I've left the code around just in case anyone shows any interest. Have a look 
[_here_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/DAPL "Go on, click it. You know you want to!") if you are interested.
