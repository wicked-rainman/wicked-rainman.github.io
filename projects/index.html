<H3>DAPL</H3>
<p>Spent quite a while writing the <i>Data Analist Programming Language</i>. It's supposed to make life
	a bit easier when your looking for interesting patterns of activity in things like Web logs Etc. 
	The whole idea seems to have fallen on deaf ears (maybe because it's no good), but I've left the code
	around just in case anyone shows any interest. Have a look 
	<u> <a href="https://github.com/wicked-rainman/DAPL">here</a></u>
	if you are interested...

<h3> Micro dot pHAT for a Raspberry Pi </h3>
<p>Recently bought a Micro Dot pHAT to go on a Raspberry Pi. It's driven using I2C and as normal I couldn't find 
	any C code to get the thing going (everyone seems to love python these days!) 
	In the end I grabbed fragments of code I found on the Internet and wrote a set of
	<a href="https://github.com/wicked-rainman/Rpi-Micro-Dot-pHAT">functions</a> that I think are useful. 
	Help yourself if you were looking for a simple solution.
