__DAPL__     

Spent quite a while writing the _Data Analist Programming Language_. It's supposed to make life a bit easier when your looking for interesting patterns of activity in things like Web logs Etc. The whole idea seems to have fallen on deaf ears (maybe because it's no good), but I've left the code around just in case anyone shows any interest. Have a look [here](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/DAPL) if you are interested.

__Micro dot pHAT for a Raspberry Pi__

[](/pictures/phat1.png)

Recently bought a Micro Dot pHAT to go on a Raspberry Pi. It comes as a kit so you have to solder on the GPIO connector and all the DIL led display chips. Took me about half an hour. It gets driven over I2C and as normal I couldn't find  any C code to get the thing going (everyone seems to love python these days!) In the end I grabbed fragments of code I found on the Internet and wrote a set of [functions](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/Rpi-Micro-Dot-pHAT) that I think are useful. Help yourself if you were looking for a simple solution.
