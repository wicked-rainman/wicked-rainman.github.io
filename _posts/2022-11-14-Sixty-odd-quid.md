I noticed that my bank account has been credited with 60 odd quid. Did a bit of research and discovered that it's one of those [_Energy Bills support scheme 
discounts_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-the-energy-bills-support-scheme-discount "AKA The Government have some free cash scheme") that I've been reading so much about in the news just recently.

I'm always onboard for a bit of free cash, but it did start me off thinking....

My understanding is that since all the energy price hikes, companies like Shell are making a huge 
[profit](https://www.offshore-energy.biz/huge-profits-for-shell-due-to-high-oil-and-gas-prices/). I don't understand where my 60 quid came from, but
my guess is it's straight out of the Government's coffers.

Doesn't that mean that [_ us normal folk _]
[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/taxpayer) are just helping to maintain Shell's 
healthy bank ballance ?
