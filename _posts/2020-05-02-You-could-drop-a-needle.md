Lockdown has started to ease.

I feel sorrow for those who have died.
I feel anxious for all those who have to go to work. 
I worry about those who live alone. 
I'm concerned for those who might loose their jobs.

In many ways, I'm lucky that I'm retired and have a decent pension to live on. I also feel guilt - I'm one of the lucky ones. 

Putting asside the many concerns, I do kind of wish town stayed as quiet as it is now. It's not often that birdsong
is louder than the souds of traffic!
