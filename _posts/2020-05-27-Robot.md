Well I finished building my robot. 

__I don't want it.__ 

I only started on it because I'm so bored with the __lockdown__.

It's the most ridiculous thing I've made in a long time. 

Two big driver servos, three sonar detectors (for collision avoidance) and a SPAD for forward scanning. 

If that wasn't bad enough, it's got two processors onboard. One for drive maneuvering and one to calculate best path. I keep thinking, what else I could have made with all that 3d printer fillament ?

By the way, SPAD stands for [single photon avalanche diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode) and nothing rude.
