Well I finished building my robot. I don't want it. I only started on it because I'm so bored with the lockdown.
It's the most ridiculous thing I've made in a long time. Two big driver servos, three sonar detectors for collision avoidance and a SPAD for forward scanning. 
If that wasn't bad enough, it's got two processors onboard. One to do the maneuvering and one to calculate best path. I keep thinking, what else I could have made with all that 3d printer fillament ?
