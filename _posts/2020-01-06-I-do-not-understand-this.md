I read in the news today that [_POTUS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") in all his wisdom, decided to wipe Qasem Soleimani off the face of the earth with one of his fancy dancy drones. I know absolutely nothing about this bloke, but if he is a baddie then why isn't someone trying to drag his sorry butt round to [_The Hague_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague "The home of international law and arbitration") ? That seems like the right thing to do and anything else just isn't cricket. 

Let's wait and see what [_Boris_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson "Born in New York City to upper-middle class British parents") has to say on the matter. You never know, he might take the moral high ground.
