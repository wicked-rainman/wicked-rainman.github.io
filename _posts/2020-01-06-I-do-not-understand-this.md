I read in the news today that [_POTUS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) in all his wisdom, decided to wipe Qasem Soleimani off the face of the earth with one of his fancy dancy drones. I know absolutely nothing about this bloke, but if he is a baddie then why isn't someone trying to drag his sorry butt round to the [Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague) ? That seems like the right thing to do and anything else just isn't cricket. 

Let's wait and see what Boris has to say. You never know, he might take the moral high ground.
