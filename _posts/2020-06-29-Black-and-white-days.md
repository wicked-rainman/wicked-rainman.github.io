40 years ago  (1980) I was a Trainee Data Processer. For me this was a big step up from my previous job as a NATO SPLC writer, but 
it still left me with my feet firmly placed at the bottom of the ladder.  To put this into context, part time cleaners felt at liberty to cock a snoot 
at me with impunity, HR didn’t exist, and a [_safe-space_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_space “a domicile for snowflakes" ) hadn’t been invented yet, I had nowhere to crawl and hide.  

Being a newbie, I was left to operate an (end of life) IBM 360/85. When left to my own devices, I recall it being quite 
fun to use, so today I decided to try and look up the specification of this behemoth. This proved quite difficult as it seems not many of 
them were made, but from what I can gather it could process 3.5K’s worth of instructions per second, had 2Mb of memory and 32K of cache. 

This machine consumed vast quantities of electricity, weighed around 6500 Kilograms and was about half the size of a tennis court.  
By today’s standards that’s not much computing power for 2 Million quid...

Roll the clock forward to today. My son has given me a Heltec single board computer. It’s got a built in screen, runs at 240Mhz, 
has 4MB of flash memory and 320KB of RAM (Ebay sell them for  just under 8 quid). 

I can’t be bothered to try and work out just how many times faster this little board is,  but it’s easily going to kick the 360 into touch.  
Maybe it’s an unfair comparison - but if it was a Raspberry Pi 4…...
