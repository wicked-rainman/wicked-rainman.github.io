__Plywood Engine__

  </div>

Decided to have a go at making a simple electric (DC) engine using wood.

Most of the components in this are made from 12mm Ply except for the crank and spokes on the fly wheel (which I made from offcuts of mahogany).

I hand wound the coil (that sits inside the piston looking bit on the drawing) on a nylon former that I turned on my lathe.
The connecting rod is made from an old 5mm diameter nail I just cut down to size. This arrangement acts like a solenoid and pulls the wheel round for part of each flywheel revolution.

The wire I used on the coil was a bit too thin (It gets warm). To make and break the coil connection I used an old scroll saw blade that sits bent out so it makes contact with the cam. The blade acts much like a microswitch (which I didn't have). When the cam rotates, the scroll saw blade touches a little metal contact to complete the coil circuit. 

The cam is an old bit of brass that I hand filed into a suitable shape. The four bearings (Two for the crank and two for the fly wheel shaft) were just odds-and-sods I had in my spares box. 

I drew up the design using Tinkercad and printed out the individual shapes on A4 as a cutting template. If you want to have a go, the STL files are [_here_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/STL/blob/master/engine.stl) and [_here_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/STL/blob/master/engine2.stl)

__Odin with Hugin and Mumin__

</div>

Found a picture of Odin with [Hugin and Munin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn "Scholars have linked Odin's relation to Huginn and Muninn to shamanic practice.") on a [web site](https://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/others/hugin-and-munin/ "Norse Mythology for Smart People provides reliable, well-documented information on the enthralling mythology and religion of the Norse and other Germanic peoples. If that’s what you’re looking for, you’ve come to the right place.")
maintained by [Daniel McCoy](https://norse-mythology.org/about-me/ "Creator of the website and the writer of all of the articles on it").

He sends them out in the morning to fly around the whole world, and by breakfast they are back again. Thus, he finds out many new things and this is why he is called ‘raven-god’ (hrafnaguð).")

Apparently the image above has been taken from an Iron Age helment found in Sweden. I've copied it and tried to convert it 
to an SVG format so it can be re-scaled. Its stored [_here_](https://github.com/wicked-rainman/Server-Vector-Graphics/blob/master/odin.svg) if you want to have a go yourself.
